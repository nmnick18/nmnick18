### A little more about me... 

I am currently working as a Full-Stack Developer in the space of healthcare with .NET, Angular, and a good amount of MSSQL. I am happy to serve at any capacity and work with folks in the healthcare industry with my ample amount of knowledge that I have learned over the course of 2 years. Also, I am a Back-end Developer primarily in Java and C#. I have been using other languages to create different microservices such as JavaScript, Go, and Python.

Working towards becoming a DevOps Engineer, I still have a long road ahead of me, but I will get their eventually.

Graduated from Georgia Tech with a bachelor degree in Computer Engineering

Space of interest: Finance, Healthcare, Education, and Wellness

#### Hobbies

Currently I am just using my extra time to work on my skillsets on the front-end and cloud and also to change my physique. I go to the gym every morning and later in the afternoon(I end up skipping if I am mentally drained), sometimes if I am just bored at 3AM I'll even hit the gym.
