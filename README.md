#### Hobbies

Before COVID, I was greatly into embedded devices, I typically would play around with an Arduino UNO to see what cool things I can make out of it.

Currently I am just using my extra time to work on skillset and also to change my physique. I go to the gym every morning and later in the afternoon(I end up skipping if I am mentally drained), sometimes if I am just bored at 3AM I'll even hit the gym.
